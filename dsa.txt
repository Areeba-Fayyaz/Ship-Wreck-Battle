Time proven it's impossible to predict my future as a

I want to be happier than today contributing by using
all the skills I will gain during
the next 5 years. "Maybe Slaving away for the company
at the same position for a
minuscule raise, if I'm lucky." 
After 5 years, I believe anything can happen because it all depends
on the choices you take. And since I want to pursue a career

in software engineering, I will be having
different certifications -
a tangible proof in knowing something. For sure,
I have learned different programming languages by that time.
Maybe at that time also,
I will be taking my Master's degree

improved skills,
good career growth and
a good leader wherein I can share my knowledge with others.

pressure previously. However, I find that when I'm under the pressure of a deadline,
I can do some of my most creative work.
I'm not a person who has a difficult time with
stress. When I'm under pressure, I focus,
and get the job done.
I've done some of my
best work under tight deadlines,
where the atmosphere was stressful.
